# Integrate AI for your rocket.chat server!

Enhance your Rocket.Chat server with AI capabilities by integrating the latest OpenAI ChatGPT-4 Turbo model for real-time messaging.
This integration does not require any installations or modifications to your Rocket.Chat server itself, making it easy to deploy.
All you need are two steps: 1. create an account for the bot on Rocket.Chat, and 2. Download this repository to your PC and run the server program.
Currently, the system supports only the OpenAI ChatGPT-4 Turbo model, but we are planning to expand support to include a variety of models in the future to accommodate a broader range of functionalities and use cases.

## Requirements
- python 3.9+  
- poetry  
- rocket.chat server version 6.x

## Setup Instructions
### 1. clone the repository
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Dot-labo/rocketchat-ai-assistant
```
   
### 2. Install dependencies
Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required dependencies using Poetry:
```
poetry install
```

### 3. Set Up the Bot Account
Set up an account on your Rocket.Chat server to be used as a bot.
Ensure that the botâ€™s username and password match those specified in the .env file created in the next step.
Once the server is launched, a service for the bot will start on each channel where the bot exists. 
If the bot is newly invited to a channel, a service will automatically start for that channel as well.
If the bot is kicked, its process will automatically stop.
   
### 4. Configure Environment
Ensure to place a .env file at the root of your project directory with the following contents.
Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual data:
```
URL=xxx.com (don't include http:// or https://)
NAME=bot
PASSWORD=password
PORT=8000
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=org-xxx (optional)
AI_PROMPT="You are ..."
```

### 5. Run the server
```
poetry shell
uvicorn main:app --port 8000
````

## Additional Information
- Ensure that your network settings allow traffic on the specified port (default: 8000).
- Occasionally, typing events fail to generate properly when using the Rocket.Chat application. It has been observed that when the Rocket.Chat app is used through a PC browser, typing events are generally sent without issues. The specific cause of the failure in other situations is unclear, but adjusting the API rate_limit settings in the management console of Rocket.Chat sometimes leads to improvement.
